<h2>About</h2>

<p> I am currently studying Data Visualization and Analysis part time at the University of Minnesota. Thus far, I have completed units in Excel (including VBA), Python (including Pandas and Matplotlib), and SQL (including SQLAlchemy). We are currently working on our web visualization unit.</p>

<p> My background is in education and academia. I have taught for more than a decade and worked with students of all ages, from preschool to adult. I have experience working with native and non-native speakers (from novice to advanced levels). While I specialize in grammar and composition, I also have substantial experience teaching reading comprehension. The bulk of my recent experience has been in college preparation: SAT and ACT preparation and college admissions advising.</p>

<p>I hope to use the skills that I am aquiring in my current training to complement my background and current career by allowing me to make more data-based recommendations for my students.</p>
